# TODO: Add Loading Indicator to Dashboard Button in Header

## Steps to Complete

1. **Check existing UI components for loading indicators** ✅
   - Read `components/ui/button.jsx` to see if it supports loading state - No built-in loading state ✅
   - Read `components/ui/progress.jsx` to check for spinner or progress components - It's a progress bar, not spinner ✅
   - Determine if we need to import a spinner from lucide-react or use existing components - Will use Loader from lucide-react ✅

2. **Modify Header component to support client-side loading state** ✅
   - Convert Header to a client component by adding 'use client' directive ✅
   - Remove async/await for checkUser since client components can't be async ✅
   - Handle user checking in a useEffect or move to layout if necessary ✅
   - Import necessary hooks: useState, useRouter, usePathname from 'next/navigation' ✅
   - Add loading state for Dashboard button and Add Transaction button ✅

3. **Implement loading logic for Dashboard and Add Transaction buttons** ✅
   - Add onClick handler to Dashboard button that sets loading true and navigates to '/dashboard' ✅
   - Add onClick handler to Add Transaction button that sets loading true and navigates to '/transaction/create' ✅
   - Use usePathname to detect when route changes to '/dashboard' or '/transaction/create' and set loading false ✅
   - Replace Link with Button and handle navigation manually ✅
   - Add loading spinner/icon to the Dashboard button when loading is true ✅
   - Add animated red progress bar to the Add Transaction button when loading is true ✅

4. **Test the implementation** ✅
   - Run the app and test clicking the Dashboard button ✅
   - Verify loading indicator appears on click and disappears when dashboard loads ✅
   - Check for any errors or issues with navigation ✅

5. **Update TODO.md** ✅
   - Mark completed steps as done ✅
   - Add any additional steps if needed during implementation ✅
